# Smart Parking with ALPD

### Functions
* Automated License plate Detection using YOLOv4 tiny
* Database system with parking lot and car information
* Unique parking space
* Automated car entry and exit
* Route to parking slot
* Calculate parking bill
* Determines user parking preference to suggest parking spots based on time of day, number of cars, and previous parking behavior.

** Example: User A parks every day from 8 am to 3 pm. At 3 pm most cars leave the parking lot. However, User B arrives at 10 am and stays for one hour. At 11 am many cars are parked. Hence, the AI appoints User A to level 3 even though the parking space is empty at 8 am and appoints User B to level 1 so both user faces less inconvenience.
